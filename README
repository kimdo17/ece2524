change_grade module takes two command line arguments: a string and a 
number, and read input formatted like ['files/grades.csv'] from standard 
input.  If the string supplied on the command line is found anywhere on 
a line of input, then the grade on that line should be changed to that 
number and the modified line printed to standard out.  Lines that do not 
match the string should be printed back to standard out unchanged.
